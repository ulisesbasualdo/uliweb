  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h2>2. Camera &amp; Microphone Access</h2>
  <p>
    Pausy requires access to your device's <strong>camera</strong> and
    <strong>microphone</strong> to provide its core functionality. These
    permissions are used solely within the app on your device.
    <strong>No audio or video data is ever uploaded, shared, or transmitted</strong>
    to any external server or third party. All processing happens locally on your
    device.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Any data created during your use of Pausy is saved exclusively on your

    sent to any remote server.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Analytics &amp; Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    Pausy does <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics services,

  </p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Pausy does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the
